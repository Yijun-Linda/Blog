In the realm of business, the interests of corporations and investors often clash with environmental and social objectives. The pursuit of high returns can sometimes lead to actions that negatively impact our planet and society. As Robert Reich aptly stated, ‚ÄúInvestors want high returns and they want environmental and social goals. But they can‚Äôt have both.‚Äù

While ESG reporting lays the groundwork for future regulations, we must recognize that robust regulatory and policy actions are essential to tackle systemic issues effectively.

I highly recommend reading this insightful post on LinkedIn: As the already-confusing "ESG debate" becomes further entangled in the spectacle of US politics, finding clear explanations from Tariq Fancy is increasingly challenging. üîΩ

Indeed, The New York Times podcast The Daily has a primer on it today that is arguably more confusing than helpful (thanks Ken Pucker for summarizing some of the issues here: [https://bit.ly/3YKLygD](https://bit.ly/3YKLygD)). By contrast here is an excellent and very straightforward piece from Robert Reich that explains what's going on in simple English. The points he makes are core to the whole problem - the rest is largely a distraction by comparison.

(And no, side note, I am not buying the argument that "Republicans are attacking ESG so therefore it must be good" - nor should you. Reich, a Democrat who served as Secretary of Labor under Clinton, presumably thinks that the 'progressive' party should have taken on this topic but didn't -- as do I.)
