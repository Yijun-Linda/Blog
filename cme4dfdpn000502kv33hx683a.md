When it comes to project management skills, I used to think it was all about writing requirement documents and holding meetings to track progress. However, after having dinner with a project manager from a major company, who is part of the post-95 generation, I learned a valuable lesson: managing AI and agents has become the most valuable "superpower" in today's workplace. Here are my takeaways~

## **What is an AI Manager?**

An AI manager is someone who knows how to plan tasks, allocate resources, give clear instructions to AI agents, provide context, and manage workflows.

## **Why is AI Project Management the Most Valuable Skill?**

Because 99% of people still treat AI as if they were managing humans.

They think AI is like a smarter PhD student, but in reality, AI is a "cognitive amplifier."

When given vague requirements, AI will only provide ten seemingly reasonable but ambiguous answers. At this point, the manager's critical thinking and judgment become crucial.

## **Aha Moment**

The moment that truly made me realize the importance was seeing how my friend manages AI and agents.

She starts by having the AI repeat its understanding from the previous day, correcting any deviations immediately. Then she updates the to-do list to help the AI refocus its attention. She also documents every failed requirement and mistake the AI makes into project rules, allowing these experiences to continuously generate compound benefits for herself and the project.

At that moment, I suddenly understood that traditional project management is about getting the team to "do things right," while the core of AI project management is to get AI to "focus on doing the right things."

## **Conclusion**

AI won't replace you, but those who know how to manage AI will.
