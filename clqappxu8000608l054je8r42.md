Unlock the Secrets: How ChatGPT **Revolutionizes** Data **Retrieval** from Reports! ðŸš€

I want GPT to perform 10x for my specific use case - Here is how

Write your very first python code on [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html#:~:text=The%20Basics,learning%2C%20data%20analysis%20and%20education.)

LangChain

Ongoing project...

I currently have two ideas related to this topic.

Project 1

Automate the process of gathering data from a report with a high volume of requests. For example, if you wish to compare a dataset across reports from over 1700 listed companies, all addressing the same question.

Project 2

Playfully employ ChatGPT to assist in cleaning the data according to the factors you've defined for your report.

However, you might be wondering, where does the data come from?

In my field, I work with data from sustainability or ESG reports, focusing on elements tied to Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions following GHG Protocol and ISO standards. As a sustainability expert, my responsibilities include gathering data from different teams within the company, refining the collected information, and presenting it in a chart.
