Why do you close your WeChat Moments while you're still sharing on the other platforms?

The thing is that I chose to deactivate my WeChat Moments not to escape from being perceived but to protect ourselves from the constant influx of perceiving others.

I want to unfold the two aspects of social media: Being seen and seen. So let's explore the subtilities of sharing and seeing.

Sharing is a choice, a display of control of one's life, yet seeing particularly on WeChat Moments, this personal friends-only platform. I think it's less about choice and more about involuntary comparisons and reflections. That's caused by some accidental emotional consequences.

Having a nice social media presence is not unsettling however it is scrolling through my friend's WeChat Moments that prompts me to question my life choices and the problem is it influences my decisions. The act of seeing others often carries much more weight than to be perceived by other people. It is a silent observer's role. A role that can unexpectedly stir introspection and self-assessment. One that can affect my behaviour.

I think the essence of social media is not just in sharing and being seen but also in how we perceive and process the information of others, especially those in our close-knit circles. I think it is important for us to discern and detach ourselves from these detrimental elements of social media while embracing those that are positive to our lives instead of forcing ourselves on social media which is an act against our curiosity and human nature. We should just be selective, teasing out parts that cause distress embrace the happiness and connection social media offers but remain vigilant to these potentials that could disrupt your life. At least for me, I think it is not about abstaining from the digital world but engaging with it in terms of my own well-being and joy.

In short, I donâ€™t want to be influenced by others, I just want to focus on my own circle.
