In the workplace, have you ever encountered a situation like this?

Your boss casually throws out an ambiguous request, such as: "Help me hire a reinforcement learning engineer."

At this point, a common reaction from beginners is:

* They start by looking at candidates' resumes, checking QS rankings, education, work experience...
    
* Then they begin to struggle with what criteria to use for ranking, getting more confused and directionless...
    
* Finally, after spending a lot of time on a report, the boss glances at it and says, "You missed the point."
    

ðŸ˜¨ **A lot of effort wasted, and efficiency is poor!**

The expert approach is to use logical thinking to break down the task and turn a vague problem into a structured analysis.

### Step 1: Break Down the Task and Identify the Real "Key Criteria"

When faced with a task, you shouldn't make decisions based on intuition. Instead, you need to **stand in the boss's shoes and understand what they truly want**.

âœ… **The boss wants the candidate's real reinforcement learning ability, not QS rankings or high education.**

So, we need to first **define key criteria**, such as:

1. **Project Experience** â€” Has this person actually worked on reinforcement learning projects?
    
2. **Code Quality** â€” Is the code open source? Are there any real contributions? Can the code run?
    
3. **Past Contributions** â€” Do they have papers, competition awards, or industry recognition in reinforcement learning?
    

These criteria allow decisions to be more data-driven rather than based on subjective judgment.

### Step 2: Data-Driven â€” Use Clear Data Analysis to Make Reliable Conclusions

With the criteria set, the next step is to **quantify the data and put the analysis into practice**.

ðŸ“Š **How to avoid "feeling good"? Use data scoring!**

| Candidate | Reinforcement Learning Project Experience | Code Quality | Papers/Contributions | Total Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A | 3 projects (5 points) | Code runs (4 points) | No papers (2 points) | 11 |
| B | 1 project (3 points) | Average code quality (3 points) | Has papers (5 points) | 11 |
| C | 2 projects (4 points) | Many open source contributions (5 points) | Published 1 paper (4 points) | 13 |

This way, you can clearly tell the boss:  
"We scored candidates based on reinforcement learning project experience, code quality, and contributions. The highest score is C, so C is more suitable."

âœ… This way, the boss only needs to glance at the conclusion to make a quick decision without being overwhelmed by a lot of scattered information.

### Step 3: Efficient Workplace Habits â€” Record Everything to Make Tasks Trackable

Here, the **"Todo List" approach in Manus Demo is very insightful**.

Many workers are accustomed to using Excel to record what they do every day, including time, tasks, and progress...

This not only helps them review their work but also **creates a clear task trail for easy review and optimization**.

ðŸŽ¯ **Three functions of a work log**:

1. **Prevent forgetting task details**
    
2. **Show your progress to the boss, increasing trust**
    
3. **Enhance a sense of accomplishment by seeing how much you've completed!**
    

Have you ever had such an experience? Worked all day but can't recall what you actually did...  
At this time, **if you have a clear Todo List, your daily efforts can be quantified, and growth becomes visible!**

### Step 4: How to Write Emails/Reports That the Boss Can Understand at a Glance?

ðŸ’¡ **The boss doesn't have time for long essays, so reports should have these three points:**

1. **Summary at the top** â€” Let the boss see the most critical insights at a glance.
    
2. **Logically break down the vague problem** â€” Tell the boss how you derived the conclusion.
    
3. **Data supports decision-making** â€” Use data, not "I think," to persuade the boss.
    

**Example 1 (Wrong Demonstration):**

ðŸš« **Report the boss can't understand**:

> These 10 candidates graduated from Stanford, MIT, CMU... Their QS rankings are 1, 3, 5... We ranked them based on their educational background as follows...

ðŸ‘Ž **Problem: The boss doesn't care about QS rankings; they want to know who has stronger reinforcement learning skills!**

**Example 2 (Correct Demonstration):**

âœ… **Report the boss prefers**:

> **Summary:**  
> We scored 10 candidates based on reinforcement learning project experience, code quality, and paper contributions. The highest score is C (total score 13), recommended for priority consideration.

> **Analysis Process:**
> 
> * We focused on candidates' practical experience in reinforcement learning, not education.
>     
> * C participated in 2 reinforcement learning projects, has excellent code quality (with open source contributions), and published papers, thus ranking first.
>     
> * A and B have advantages in different areas, with the same total score, but slightly weaker code ability than C.
>     

> **Data Analysis:** (Attached Excel sheet)

ðŸ‘‘ **Such a report allows the boss to understand your thought process at a glance, making decisions more efficient!**

### Step 5: Critical Thinking â€” How to Demonstrate Thinking Ability in Daily Work?

In Manus's second Demo, there is an example about **Redfin vs. Trulia**.

In the U.S. real estate market, some know **Redfin**, and some know **Trulia**, but their user groups and market positioning are slightly different.

This actually involves a very important question:  
ðŸ¤” **When faced with multiple choices, how do you make decisions?**

ðŸŽ¯ **Excellent professionals actively think about the logic behind information rather than passively accepting information.**

Just like YZ said, "The new team member looked at his report and asked what to do."  
True experts **won't wait for others to tell them what to do but will actively think about "why do it?" and "how to do it better?"**.

### Summary: How to Turn Vague Problems into High-Quality Analysis?

ðŸ’¡ **Summary of "Expert Thinking" in the Workplace:**  
âœ… **Break down tasks and grasp the real key points (Logical Thinking)** â€” Don't get stuck in vague problems, but break them down into structured analysis.  
âœ… **Speak with data, not intuition (Data Analysis)** â€” Make decisions more evidence-based, not just gut feelings.  
âœ… **Efficient recording, enhance a sense of accomplishment (Todo List habit)** â€” Make work organized, easy to review and optimize.  
âœ… **Write reports for the boss, starting with conclusions, then logic** â€” Let the boss see key insights at a glance, improving work efficiency.  
âœ… **Cultivate Critical Thinking and actively think about the logic behind** it â€” Enhance your analytical skills, not just passive execution.

If you can master these ways of thinking, **whether in the workplace or in future entrepreneurship, you can solve problems more efficiently!**
