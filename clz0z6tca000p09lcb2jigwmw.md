You might be wondering what is Adventure X.

I connected with top talents in the field of AIx and LLM agents. I am so proud of joining this hackathon, which had an enrollment rate of only 13%. This means that out of more than 2,000 candidates, only 200 top talents were selected for inspiration and collaboration.

During the hackathon, I learned several new skills. Initially, I was focused on building a website, which required extensive front-end knowledge and skills, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. However, we are now in the era of AI. Gamma, an AI-powered application, can help us build a website more easily.

Here is our demo website: [https://interstellar-plant-facto-a0br26i.gamma.site](https://interstellar-plant-facto-a0br26i.gamma.site/)

AI marketing tools

AI image generators like DALL·E 3 and Midjourney

Our poster was entirely created using DALL·E 3 and Midjourney.

AI video generators like Pika Lab and Light Year AI.

Our commercial video also uses the power of AI.

The lesson I have learned is that the secret of creating a video using AI is the quality of the prompt after devoting 40+ hours.

Check it out, this is our project!

Demo day: We were at the expo to share our project with investors and visitors！
