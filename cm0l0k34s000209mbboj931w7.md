10 days ago, I had a crazy idea to retrieve ESG data using GPT, essentially creating an LLM agent. (You might find a trace of it on my GitHub :D  
  
Today, I found this paper on arXiv, which is exactly what I want to solve.  
  
Exciting to share! Congratulations to [Lokesh Mis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/exomishra/)[hra and his t](https://www.linkedin.com/in/exomishra/)eam for making it count.

Diving into the world of AI Agents has been a game-changer for me. It's like discovering a whole new universe where technology and intelligence converge, and I'm all in!
