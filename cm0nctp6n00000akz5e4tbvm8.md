Investment management is a crucial tool for mitigating material ESG risks in portfolios. The intricate relationship between fixed income management and ESG has been gaining significant attention in recent times. The savvy investor recognizes that a company's environmental and social impact can have a significant effect on its long-term financial performance.  
  
The integration of ESG factors in investment decisions can help create sustainable, profitable, and socially responsible portfolios. Interestingly, the relationship between fixed-income management and ESG has recently garnered increased attention.  
  
Understanding a company's capital structure is vital in this regard. Bondholders, in particular, are uniquely positioned to influence company management to take ESG considerations seriously. As such, investors must examine bondholders' commitment to company management to determine whether the company's ESG commitments are likely to be fulfilled.  
  
In sum, investment management offers a powerful mechanism for managing material ESG portfolio risks. By recognizing the importance of ESG considerations in equity and fixed-income management, investors can make informed decisions promoting financial returns and social responsibility.
