At the core of incorporating ESG principles into a business lies governance, and governance commences with the board. ESG is a multifaceted concept that encompasses the social aspects of a company's connections with its stakeholders, such as building trust among stakeholders, safeguarding brand and reputation, and fulfilling the pressing need for effective governance, transparency, and business resilience.  
  
The critical question at hand is how to manage risks in board governance and committee structures: Is there a governance structure that can provide a comprehensive view of risk and respond to opportunities that arise from the growing emphasis on ESG? What are the most significant risks, and where does accountability for each risk area rest on the board, committees, and management?  
  
The board holds the responsibility and oversight for strategy and enterprise risk management (ERM), which is closely linked to ESG risks (ESG risks are essentially business risks), particularly climate-related risks. Therefore, Incorporating ESG considerations throughout the company, including at the board level, is vital for enabling firms to detect and address rapidly emerging and evolving risks.  
  
Ultimately, a strong governance structure that takes into account ESG considerations will not only help businesses manage risks and seize opportunities but also contribute to a more sustainable and responsible business model. Boards are likely to become more aware of considering these risks within the broader category of developing ESG topics and identifying key corporate risks and determining who owns each risk on the board.
