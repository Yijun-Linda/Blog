Today, I am writing an article, [Week 48: Say goodbye to ESG ratings, from Sasja Beslik](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/week-48-say-goodbye-esg-ratings-sasja-beslik?trackingId=6LeCRf1qR%2BtRRmnia2i%2FFA%3D%3D&lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_recent_activity_content_view%3Ba%2B4KRjUyQVSjISrxTQxjNw%3D%3D)

The current state of ESG ratings has been a point of contention for many investors. The idea of investing in companies that prioritize sustainable practices and good governance is appealing, but the implementation of ESG ratings has come under scrutiny.  
  
Critics argue thatÂ there is no clear correlation between a company's ESG rating and its business growth strategy. ESG investing has been criticized by some as nothing more than a marketing ploy, with financial institutions using sustainability as a way to sell their products to socially conscious investors. Additionally, some investors are concerned that the focus on ESG metrics is detracting from the primary goal of investing: making money.  
  
Furthermore, ESG investing has its flaws, and the financial industry is ultimately driven by profit. there is a risk that ESG investing can become a form of greenwashing, whereby companies make cosmetic changes to their practices to improve their ESG ratings without actually addressing the underlying issues. While it is admirable to invest based on environmental, social, and governance factors, these factors are often ambiguous and difficult to measure objectively.
